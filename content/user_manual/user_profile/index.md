## Updating your profile info

### Uploading a profile photo
When you first create a Loomio account, your initials will be the default image associated with your profile. You can upload a profile photo by clicking **Change picture** in the **Picture** section of your profile page. If you have a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) you can set that as your profile picture by selecting **Use Gravatar**.

### Update your personal info

You can update:
* your name,
* your username (your username is the name people will use to @mention you in comments),
* your email address,
* your introduction (a few lines to let other members know more about you),
* your location (useful for distributed groups so people can get an idea of where others are)

## Language settings
Loomio is developed in English, but [is translated by volunteers into many languages]({{ site.loomio_app_url }}/g/cpaM3Hsv/loomio-community-translation).

Loomio will detect your browser’s language settings, but you can manually set your preferred language from the profile page.

## Deactivating your account
If you no longer want to receive notifications from Loomio, but think that you may want to access your account again some time in the future, you can deactivate your account.

To deactivate your account
1. Login to loomio with the email address of the account you wish to deactivate
2. Visit the "Edit profile" page from the user menu (top right corner of the screen).
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Deactivate account"
4. Confirm you wish to deactivate.

Once your account has been deactivated:

* you will no longer be listed as a member of any groups
* comments, proposals and discussions you’ve made will remain but your name will be removed from them
* you will no longer receive Loomio-related emails

### Reactivating your account
If you login to your account with your email address you'll reactivate your account and regain access to your groups.

## Permanently deleting your account
Deleting is similar to deactivating your account however your user account record is permanently deleted from our database. This removes your personally identifying information including your name and email address. Your comments and other content will remain but it will show as being written by "deactivated user".
