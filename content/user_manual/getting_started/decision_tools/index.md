Decisions happen in *threads*. Loomio does not make decisions for you; rather, the tool is designed to:

* communicate what decision is being made
* make it easy to participate
* highlight agreement and surface disagreement
* build shared understanding
* and keep people informed of progress.

It's up to each group to decide how to interpret the results. For instance, [here's the decision-making protocol for the Enspiral community](https://handbook.enspiral.com/agreements/decisions.html). They have defined specific criteria for three different types of decision, e.g., how long the decision must be open for input, and what percentage of the group must participate to make a binding decision.

Loomio provides a range of tools to support your group decision-making.

## All Loomio decision tools follow a common pattern

1. Author starts a discussion thread, and invites members. At any point, a member can start a decision, using any of the available Loomio decision tools
2. Member sets up the decision with title, details and options
3. People participate
4. People can change their minds as understanding develops
5. A reminder is sent out the day before closing
6. The poll closes, and everyone is informed of the results
7. The author sets an outcome, notifying everyone of what will happen next.
