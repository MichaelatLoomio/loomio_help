## Configure your email settings

Email notifications are an important way for Loomio to keep people updated on what's happening in your group.

When you (or your group members) start your account, by _default_ Loomio will:

- send you a **daily digest** of everything you missed the day before
- let you know when someone's trying to get your attention via **mentions & replies**
- **subscribe upon participation**, sending emails for every comment on threads you're interested in.
- immediately email you **announcements**: invitations to proposals, polls, or threads

This helps to keep people engaged in the early stages of a group. We set this default assuming that you and your group members will not yet have a habit of using Loomio regularly so are designed to ensure you can stay up to date by checking your emails.

For any group, subgroup, or thread, you can

- receive emails for **all activity**
- only important activity (**announcements**)
- choose to receive **no emails**

Go to your [email settings](https://www.loomio.org/email_preferences) to configure them to suit your preferences. This page is found by clicking on your picture, or initials, in the top right corner of Loomio.

# Profile settings

Your profile page lets you customise your Loomio identity. To visit your profile page select the **Edit profile** option in the user menu, at the top-right of your screen.

## Uploading a profile photo
When you first create a Loomio account, your initials will be the default image associated with your profile. You can upload a profile photo by clicking **Change picture** in the **Picture** section of your profile page. If you have a [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) you can set that as your profile picture by selecting **Use Gravatar**.

## Update your personal info

You can update:

* your name,
* your username (your username is the name people will use to alert you with an @mention in threads),
* your email address,
* your introduction (a few lines to let other members know more about you),
* your location (useful for distributed groups so people can get an idea of where others are)

## Language settings
Loomio is developed in English, but [is translated by volunteers into many languages](https://www.loomio.org/g/cpaM3Hsv/loomio-community-translation).

Loomio will detect your browserâ€™s language settings, but you can manually set your preferred language from the profile page.
