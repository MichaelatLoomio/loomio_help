## Where is my confirmation email?
If you don’t receive an email confirming your group registration, you might need to check your spam or junk mail folder – sometimes they end up in there.

## I’ve forgotten my password, what do I do?
If you’ve forgotten your password click the **"Forgot your password?"** link on the [Log in page](https://www.loomio.org/users/sign_in "opens in new tab"). You will be asked to enter the email address associated with your Loomio account and password reset instructions will be sent to this email address.

## Do I need a Loomio account to participate in discussions?
Yes. Even though there are different levels of group privacy, everyone who wishes to participate in a Loomio group needs to have a Loomio account.

## Does it cost to use Loomio?
Check out our pricing plans [here](https://www.loomio.org/pricing).

## How can I stop my signature being included in email replies to threads?
There is currently no official standard for distinguishing email signatures from the rest of the email body. To a computer the whole email is just a block of text. The easiest method we have for marking the end of the email body and the beginning of the signature is the double-dash method popularised by Gmail, which involves inserting a double-dash ('--') on its own line between the body of an email and the signature. Other common formats are recognised too, but Gmail's method is very easy to implement. Most programs trying to separate email body from signature (including Loomio) will correctly ignore email signatures if these dashes are included in the right place.

To be sure that your email signature is not included in your comment when you reply by email, you need to begin your signature with a double hyphen on its own line.

## Will Loomio work on my phone or tablet?
Loomio is mobile responsive, so it will work on any device through a browser.

## How can I reactivate my account?
To have your account reactivated, [contact us](https://loomio.org/contact "opens in new tab").

## I’ve deactivated my group, can I restore it?
Deactivated groups can only be restored by a member of the Loomio team. [Contact us](https://loomio.org/contact "opens in new tab") to reactivate your group.

## What if I have a feature to suggest?
We also have an open Loomio Community sub-group dedicated to [Feature Ideas](https://www.loomio.org/g/GN7EFQTK/loomio-community-feature-ideas "opens in new tab"). You can contribute to discussions about new features there, or make suggest your own feature ideas.
