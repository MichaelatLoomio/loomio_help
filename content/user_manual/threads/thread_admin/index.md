To get the most out of the effectiveness and efficiency that Loomio offers, you may want to manage the discussion threads and the communications they contain.

While some of these actions are taken from _within_ threads, we'll start outside the threads, on any page where threads are listed (Group, Unread threads, or Recent threads page).

## Understanding thread previews

To help you stay on top of everything, the thread preview is a quick glance at the some important details about a thread.

![](thread_preview.png)

It shows

- The title
- Who first authored it - _the picture or initials to the left of the title_
- If it has an active proposal or poll - _a relevant visual/graph will replace the author_

> _Note:_ your participation (eg, Agree) is superimposed on this graph. A question mark indicates you have not participated

- What group or subgroup it is in - _just below the title_
- How many comments or votes - _X replies_
- If there has been activity that you haven't seen yet - _yellow stripe on the left_
- How many of these you have yet to see - _Y unread_
- When the last comment or vote was submitted - _Last active Z ago_

# Top-level options

You can access a number of options by selecting the ⋯ three horizontal dots to the right of a thread's title. The following administrative actions are taken from pages that list threads.

## Mute

Mute threads that you do not wish to receive email notifications nor see in your Unread or Recent threads pages.

To mute a thread, you must first navigate to the Unread threads or Recent threads page. Mute is not available when you are on your group page (unlike other top-level options for threads).

NOTE: You will still receive notifications if you are directly mentioned, replied to, or invited to participate in a thread, poll, or proposal.

## Category tags

**Category tags** (or just "tags") let you group any number of threads by categories that you define. You can use them to make it easy to find threads of a certain type or topic.

To apply a tag to a thread, go into the thread's options and choose Category tags. Select the desired tag(s) from the dropdown list of tags that your group already uses, or type in a new tag and press the enter key. Finally, click **Save**.

## Close thread

To keep the list of discussions on your group page relevant, you can close threads which people don't need to see.

![](close_button.png)

You can list all the closed threads. Just click the "x Closed" label at the top of the threads list on your group page.

# Group page options

There are several thread options only accessible from the Group to which the thread belongs.

## Pin thread
If you are a coordinator, you can pin comments to order them and make them easier to find. Pinned threads will appear above your other threads and will be ordered alphanumerically within the group (and, if applicable, also the subgroup) to which they belong. You can easily pin or unpin threads by clicking the pin icon from the discussion thread's page.

Or, use the pin option from the thread menu.

## Move thread

You may want to move threads between groups and subgroups to keep things organised. To do this, select _Move_ from the thread options.

## Delete thread

If you're the admin of a group you can delete any thread – or comments in any of the threads – in the group. If you started a thread, you can delete that thread, or any comments within it.

### Deleting comments
You can delete your own comments at any time.

Again, admin can delete any comment.

# Options from within a thread

The following administrative actions are taken by first navigating to the page of the thread in question and then using the options at the bottom of the thread's context. _The_ **⋯** _three horizontal dots at the bottom-right will reveal more options._

## Moving comments to a new thread (Forking)

</video>

Sometimes a comment is useful, but off topic for the thread. In this case you can start a new discussion (forking), selecting the comments you want to take into it from the original thread.

## Printing threads

Select _Print thread_ in the thread options to create or print a PDF with all of the thread's contents.

## Thread members and roles
Everyone who's participated in the thread, or has been invited specicially to participate will show up in the members panel.

![](thread_members_card.png)

To highlight your role within the discussion, or to let people know why you're here, you can update your _title_ from the members card. The title will display next to your name wherever it appears within the thread.
