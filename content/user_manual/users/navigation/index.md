## Search
The search field is easy to find above the list of threads on most pages. It will display threads containing your keyword(s) in their context, comments or decisions.

**From the Recent Threads page:** When you first arrive to the app you are viewing your Recent Threads. Enter one or more key words to find the information you're looking for from any group.

**From a group page:** If you are on your group or subgroup's page, you can search _within_ that group. The search will exclude results from other groups or subgroups.

## Notifications

The ðŸ”” bell icon, which lives on the top-right, will show all activities in threads you've started or participated in and all @mentions. Just click on one of them to see details or participate.

When someone wants to get your attention, they'll send you a notification. This could be via an @mention or an invitation to participate in a thread or poll. [More on _notifying people_ here](http://localhost:1313/en/user_manual/threads/notifying_people/).

If you have unread notifications we'll display the number that are unread over the top of the bell-shaped notifications menu button.

## User menu
The user menu is where you can access your user profile page, change your email preferences, find a link to this help manual, and sign out. Find it by clicking your name in the sidebar (see [video above](#top-level) for reference, you may have to first open the sidebar by clicking the â˜° icon in the top-left).

- You can view and update your user profile via **Edit profile**. Read the [User profile](../user_profile) page for more information.

- You can change your email preferences via **Email settings**. Read the [Email settings](../email_settings) page to find out how to set things up to your liking.

- You'll also find a link to all our help resources, including this user manual.

- You can log out of Loomio, which is recommended if you're not using a personal device to access it.

## Sidebar
The sidebar is where you find your discussions and your groups. It is displayed by default on large screens, and collapsed by default on small screens (such as smartphones), but can be opened or closed via the using the â˜° horizontal bars icon in the top-left of the screen.

### Pin sidebar
If you pin the sidebar, then it will be open when you first arrive to any Loomio page, and will reopen (if you have closed it) upon navigation to any other page or tab.

## Recent threads

The **Recent threads** page gives you an overview of the most recent activity happening in your groups. You can access this page via the sidebar. If you are a member of multiple groups, the **Recent Threads** page will be your landing page when you sign into Loomio.

The **Recent Threads** page displays content from your groups in a prioritised list. Open proposals are at the top, followed by all of the threads from your groups, sorted by most recent activity; **Today**, **Yesterday**, **This month**, **Older than a month**.

If a thread or proposal title is **bold** then new activity has taken place since you last visited. Numbers in parentheses reflect how many new comments or votes have been posted since you last visited a particular thread. Decisions will show a graphic representation (a pie graph for proposals, bar charts for other poll types), with your position on the proposal superimposed on the graph. If you havenâ€™t yet stated a position, there will be a question mark.

## Unread threads

The **Unread threads** page shows all threads and proposals that have new content since you last visited, sorted by group. You can access this page via the sidebar. You can clear unread items without reading them by hovering over the thread preview and clicking **Dismiss**.

## Muted

The **Muted** page displays all threads you have previously muted. It can be accessed via the **Muted** option in the sidebar. Muted threads do not appear on your **Recent** or **Unread** pages.  You can mute a thread by hovering over the thread preview on the group page, **Recent Threads** page, or **Unread Threads** page, and using the **Mute** button.

## Viewing your groups
All the groups you belong to are listed in the sidebar, on the left hand side. If you are only a member of one Loomio group, the home page for this group will be your landing page when you sign into Loomio. If you have multiple groups you can easily navigate between them from using the sidebar.

If you belong to a Gold or Pro group, then you will also see all related sub-groups that you are a part of, listed in lighter grey text, under the main group.

## Exploring public groups
You can explore, and request membership to, public Loomio groups by visiting the **Explore** page. The **Explore** page is accessed via the **Explore public groups** option in the sidebar.
