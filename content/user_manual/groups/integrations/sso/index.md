## Single Sign On (SAML)

If your organization uses an authentication service such as OneLogin, Auth0, or Microsoft Teams, you can integrate this with your Loomio group.

This feature is available to all organizations with a Pro subscription and is in a public beta.

As this is a beta release we are currently working on documenting the setup process for each Sign on Provider. Please email contact@loomio.org for support to connect your specific provider to your Loomio group.
