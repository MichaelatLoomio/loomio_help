...and then follow the prompts above in the Set up Slack integration.

## Microsoft Teams

Find the "Microsoft teams" card in your group sidebar.

From Microsoft teams you need to add a new connector. See [this page](https://kb.itglue.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001798191-Setting-up-Microsoft-Teams-webhook-notifications) for help with that.

Hopefully from your time in the MS teams connector interface, you'll have a Webhook URL that you can put into Loomio.

Enter the webhook URL and select which events you'd like to see mentioned within the microsoft teams interface.

You'll receive a success message in Loomio as well as a message within Teams saying you're connected.
