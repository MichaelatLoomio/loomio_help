# Coordinators

Only group coordinators can edit group settings.

As a coordinator of a Loomio group youâ€™re responsible for guiding your group through the process of learning how to use a new piece of software, as well as learning new processes for collaborating more effectively and making good decisions together. The tasks outlined below can only be performed by group coordinators.

To learn how to edit the basics such as your Group description or Cover photo, see [starting a group](/en/user_manual/getting_started/starting_a_group).

# Advanced settings

Coordinators set the group permissions to configure what members can do in their group.

[Note to add to Group settings page: Subgroups

## Allow members of parent group to see threads

_Only subgroups have this setting._

Allows members of the parent group to see discussions within the subgroup.
For example a Closed subgroup includes the permission - "Members of [parent group] can see private threads".  The default setting for this permission is 'off'.]

## Allow public threads

In **Closed** groups, you can use this option to allow public and private threads in your group. When you start a thread, you can decide whether it will be public or private.

## Invite and approve new members

This allows everyone in your group to invite new people in, and approve any membership requests. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to invite and approve new members.

## Create sub-groups

This allows everyone in your group to create subgroups. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to create subgroups.

## Start threads

This allows everyone in your group to start new threads. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to start discussions.

## Edit the context of any thread in the group

This allows everyone in your group to edit the context of any thread. When it is deselected only group coordinators and the thread author will be able to edit the thread context.

## Edit their comments at any time

This allows everyone in your group to [edit their comments](../../threads/#editing-comments) at any time. When it is deselected, a comment can only be edited until someone else participates in the thread.

## Raise proposals

This allows anyone in your group to start a proposal within a thread. When this box is deselected only group coordinators will be able to raise proposals.

## Vote on proposals

This allows everyone in your group to state their position on proposals. When it is deselected only group coordinators will be able to state their position on proposals.

# Deactivating/archiving a group

Deactivating your group means that you and the rest of the group members will no longer be able to access the group. If you wish to deactivate your group you can do so by selecting **Deactivate Group** from the **Options** menu on the group page. To reactivate your deactivated group, [contact Loomio support](https://www.loomio.org/contact).
