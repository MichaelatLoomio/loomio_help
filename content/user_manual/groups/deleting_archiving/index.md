From the **Settings** tab of your group page you can either deactivate or delete your group.

## Deactivate group

Deactivating means that you and the rest of the group members will no longer be able to access the group.

Find this option near the bottom of your group's Settings, click **Deactivate group** and then **OK**.

To reactivate your deactivated group, [contact Loomio support](https://loomio.org/contact).

## Delete group

All threads, polls, files and other group content will be permanently deleted when you **delete group**. It is recommended that you [export](../data_export) the group data and manually download any important files you have uploaded before you continue.

From Settings: **Delete group**, type in your group's name, and click **OK**. ***This is non-reversible!***
