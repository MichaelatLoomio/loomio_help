## Comments and replies
The most common activity in a thread is commenting and replying. The comment box is at the bottom of the thread page. Just write your comment in the box and press **Post** to have your say.

When you reply to a comment the author of the original comment will be notified of your reply.

If Loomio has emailed you a comment (and says you can reply to the email), you can reply directly from your email and your message will appear in the thread.

## Formatting comments
Loomio uses _Markdown_ to format text and embed images. For more information on how to use Markdown, read [this guide](https://www.loomio.org/markdown).

## Attaching files
You can attach files to comments using the attachment button next to the **Post** button on the comment form. You will be prompted to select a file from your device.

## Editing comments

If you've made a typo, or want to add a bit more information to your comment shortly after you've posted it, you can edit your comment. Editing does not grab any attention, IE: No notifications will be sent, and your comment will not be marked as unread again.

Changes you've made will be visible via the "history" button, so you can see what people have changed in their comment.

If you have new information or are coming back after an extended period of time, just make a new comment, then people who have already read your comment will see that there is new information.

## Reactions
![](reactions.png)
Reactions are for sharing how a comment made you feel, or acknowledging something someone has said, without writing a comment. They're an unobtrusive, light-weight way to participate without interrupting the conversation.

## Automatic translation

Loomio can translate a comment from one language into another automatically (with the help of Google Translate). If the author of a comment uses a language other than yours, a translate button will show up; Just click to see the translation.

## Decision tools
![](decision_tools_card.png)
There are a selection of "decision tools" available to you within the thread.
- Proposals are there to help you see if there is agreement about a statement or course of action, and surface the disagreement if that's what needs to happen. Often, you can use proposals to bring the discussion to conclusion.
- Polls are useful to understand preferences of the group.
- Use a time poll if you need to get everyone together, and want to find the best time for that meeting to happen.

Find out more about [decision tools](../getting_started/decision_tools).

## Email notifications
By default you'll be subscribed to receive email notifications about activity in threads in which you are participating. If you don't want email notifications, [edit your preferences](https://www.loomio.org/email_preferences) and turn off "Subscribe on participation".

If you're already subscribed to a thread, you'll need to turn off emails for it, because "subscribe on participation" only takes effect for threads you participate in after changing the setting.

![](email_settings_in_thread_dropdown.png)

The default setting is "Announcements", which means you'll get an email notification when someone wants to notify you about a decision, but you won't get an email about comments unless you're mentioned or someone replies to one of your comments.
