## Title and Details

**Writing proposals**

Include enough details so everyone knows what it means to agree or disagree.

Avoid combining a range of ideas in one proposal, because people might agree to some aspects but not others and be unsure how to respond. You can break complex decisions down into multiple proposals.

When making a proposal, state your expectations and describe the impact the proposal will have if adopted. If it's a formal or binding proposal it's often worth describing what a 'disagree' or 'block' means.

You might want to explore a few [ways of using proposals](#ways-of-using-proposals), below, for some guidance and inspiration.

## Dates/How Long

**Closing time**

Consider how the proposal closing time will affect engagement from your group members, and choose accordingly. You might want to time the proposal so it closes before a meeting, or avoid closing over a weekend.

You can extend the deadline of an open proposal. This can be a good idea if engagement is active and people are working through the issue, or if engagement has been sparse and you'd like to prompt more participation before concluding.

## Invite Members

**All Loomio decisions follow a common pattern.**

1. Author starts a discussion thread, and invites members. At any point, a member can start a decision, using any of the available Loomio decision tools
2. Member sets up the decision with title, details and options
3. People participate
4. People can change their minds as understanding develops
5. A reminder is sent out the day before closing
6. The poll closes, and everyone is informed of the results
7. The author sets an outcome, notifying everyone of what will happen next.

## Ways of using proposals

### Uncover the controversy

_E.g. Let's put a bike stand next to the front desk_

If there are two or more competing ideas, propose supporting one. Controversial topics might require a series of proposals to build shared understanding.

### Series of small Yes's

_E.g. We host the conference; dates and venue to be confirmed later_

Break down a complex issue into smaller parts and agree on them piece by piece.

### Polarising Minority

_E.g. Share our pay rates publicly_

Sometimes loud voices can seem like they are representing more of the group than they really are. Raise a proposal to put their views in perspective.

### Temperature Check

_E.g. Temperature Check: we should change the privacy policy_

A temperature check is a way to test how the group feels without concluding a fully realized proposal. Use it when you want to survey opinions, or test a hunch, rather than advocate for a particular position.

### On disagreement

'Disagree' and 'block' are often controversial positions to take. We encourage you to see them as opportunities to understand where communication has been inadequate, points of view are under-represented, or as a source of valuable insight.

If things feel tense on a personal level, we recommend that you talk one on one with the person to hear their concerns.
