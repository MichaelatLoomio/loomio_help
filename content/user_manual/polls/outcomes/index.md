## Setting an outcome

When your proposal closes, youâ€™ll be prompted to set a proposal outcome.

In Loomio, it's not assumed that majority wins - the outcome or conclusion of a decision is up to you to define on behalf of the group. Sometimes it makes sense to go with the majority, but sometimes even one dissenting voice means it's a no.

Group members will be notified of the outcome, so it's a very useful tool for keeping people in the loop. You can clearly define next steps and name specific actions, or summarise what was learned from the process.

Examples:

_This proposal did not reach consensus because several people were concerned about budget impacts. George and Jimena will do some financial modelling and raise a new proposal next week._

or

_I've taken on board everyone's input. As the project manager, this is my call to make and I've decided we are going to extend the timeline by 10 days._

Setting outcomes makes your decision archive easy to search, because you have a succinct statement for each proposal.
