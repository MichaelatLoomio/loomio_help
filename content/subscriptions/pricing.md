# Overview

Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.

As a social enterprise and worker cooperative, our values are reflected in both the design of the software and how we operate as a business.

We do not monetize your data or attention. We will never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes. You are free to export your data at any time.

## Inclusive pricing model
Our goal is to provide Loomio to as many people as possible, while also developing the Loomio platform so it can better serve you.

To sustainably work towards our vision, we have structured our pricing based on the type of organization we serve.

We aim to offer a competitive price for enterprise organizations, an affordable price for businesses, nonprofit organizations, and special rates for community groups.

Loomio is open source software, and you are free to set up your own instance of Loomio.

# Active use subscription plan

Simple, transparent pricing automatically adjusts to your changing needs.

A Loomio subscription is one price per group, calculated according to the total number of active users in your group - enabling maximum flexibility and scalability.

Loomio counts a person by their unique user account, who is participating in your group and any subgroups or threads.

__Active users__ are people in your group who start threads and polls, or comment or vote in them.

People who visit the group, read content and leave reactions are not charged.

This means you can invite everyone in your organization into your group, and will only be charged for those who are active.

## Free trial

All new groups start on a free trial, so you can evaluate Loomio with your group.

Free trials are for 14 days, limited to 20 people and 20 threads.

Contact us if you need to extend your trial.

At the end of the trial period you will be asked to upgrade to a paid subscription plan.

## How Active pricing works

At time of upgrade to an Active plan, you will be charged for the number of active users in your group.  The minimum price for the plan is charged if there are 10 or less active users.  Additional active users are charged at the plan rate.

### For monthly Active plans;

Loomio checks the number of active users in your group daily.

If there is an increase in active users, the new active users are charged a pro-rated amount for the month. The charge is accrued for payment at the next monthly billing renewal date.

If there is a decrease in active users, the decreased number of active users is credited to the subscription.

In all cases, the minimum subscription payment of up to 10 active users applies.

Example: At time of upgrade, Mary has 10 active users in her group, and pays $30 on the 1st of the month.

On the 15th of the month (half-way through the current billing cycle), Loomio detects 10 new active users have joined Mary’s group. Mary’s account is charged 10 active users x $3.00 x 15 days remaining / 30 days in current month = $15.00. The charge is accrued for payment at the next monthly renewal date.

At the monthly billing renewal date, Mary is charged $75.00:
- $60.00 (for the new total of 20 active users)
- $15.00 (for the 10 new active users accrued in past month)

On the 15th of the next month (half-way through the next billing cycle), Loomio detects that 5 people are no longer active users. Mary’s account is credited with minus 5 active users x $3.00 x 15 days remaining / 30 days in current month = $7.50. The credit is accrued to offset payment at the next monthly renewal date.

At the monthly billing renewal date, Mary is charged $52.50:
- $45.00 (for the new total of 15 active users)
- Credit $7.50 (for the decrease in 5 active users accrued from past month)

Mary receives a monthly statement detailing the charges and credits processed.

### For annual Active plans;

Loomio checks the number of active users in your group monthly.

If there is an increase in active users, the new active users are charged a pro-rated amount for the year. If a payment for new active users is due, it is automatically charged monthly.

If there is a decrease in active users, the decreased number of active users is credited to the subscription.

If the number of people in your group decreases, the price will reduce accordingly at the next billing cycle (monthly or annually). All payments are in advance and no credit is provided.
