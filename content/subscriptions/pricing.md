## Overview
Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.

<!-- Our vision is to help organizations like yours work better together, now and into the future. -->

As a social enterprise and worker cooperative, our values are reflected in both the design of the software and how we operate as a business.

We do not monetize your data or attention. We will never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes. You are free to export your data at any time.

### Inclusive pricing model
Our goal is to provide Loomio to as many people as possible, while also developing the Loomio platform so it can better serve you.

To sustainably work towards our vision, we have structured our pricing based on the type of organization we serve.  

We aim to provide a competitive price for commercial customers, an affordable price for volunteer organizations (member/donor-funded), as well as a free plan for unfunded community groups.
