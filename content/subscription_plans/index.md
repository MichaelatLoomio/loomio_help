# Overview

Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives. Our vision is to help organizations like yours work better together, now and into the future.

As a social enterprise and worker cooperative, our values are reflected in both the design of the software and how we operate as a business.

**Inclusive pricing model**

Our goal is to continue providing Loomio to as many people as possible, while also developing the Loomio platform so it can better serve you. To sustainably work towards our vision and support you, we have structured our pricing based on the type of organization we serve.  

We aim to provide a competitive price for commercial customers, an attractive and affordable price for volunteer organizations (e.g., member- or donor-funded), as well as a free option for unfunded community groups. [Learn more](/subscription_plans/#Loomio-subscription-plans).

**No time-limit on free trials**

We offer free trials to all new Loomio users, giving you the chance to evaluate Loomio and see if it is the right fit for your group. There is no time limit for the free trial. However, please note that trials are limited to 20 users and 10 threads. [Learn more](/subscription_plans/#Free-trial).

**Protecting your data**

The privacy of your data is our top priority. We will never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes. We only share personal data when it is necessary for the provision of our service.

Volunteer organizations include community and activist organizations, collectives, sports, and other clubs, and spiritual groups.

As an unfunded community group, you can apply to our Community Application form to use Loomio for Free.

We have many groups around the world using Loomio for free. We aim to approve applications within 48 hours.

**Does your group qualify?**

Unfunded community groups and organizations do not have any funds or a bank account, no one is paid, and the group is not generating income.
