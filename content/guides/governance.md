### Create a place for your board

Just trying to learn how to write a useful introduction/ Group Description for your group? Read on. Otherwise our new [virtual board meetings guide](../virtual_board_meetings/) will take you through all the steps for setting up.

A Loomio group is a secure online place for your board. A Loomio group helps you increase communication and continue work between meetings, connecting your members wherever they are and at a time that suits them.


1) In the Group description box write a clear purpose for why you have set up this group and a reason why people should join.
For example; *"This is the place for our board to have discussions and make decisions between meetings. Let's save time, save on email and have better meetings."*

2) Consider what kind of decisions we will make in this group.
For example; _"Decisions we make on Loomio between meetings will be acknowledged in the minutes of the next board meeting."_

3) Consider who is involved and what we expect of each other.
For example; _"This is a private group for access by directors, CEO and company secretary. Feel free to contribute and raise new topics by starting a new thread."_

4) Consider how will Loomio complement our existing processes?
For example; _"We will use Loomio to set the board meeting agenda, prepare and upload board papers, agree actions, approve meeting minutes and discuss issues we do not have time to cover during meetings."_
